# Description (background)

The purpose of this project was to create pliers with different materials to practice print-in-place parts. In order to measure the efficacy of design, the pliers were tested to carry at minimum one resistor.

Print-in-place parts refers to any printable design that has interlocking or moving mechanisms printed as a single assembly (1). Consistent with their singular print, parts are distinct in that they are simultaneous in movement. Asides from educational purposes such as for this project, there are many real world examples of print-in-place parts. An example of this can be seen in living hinges which is essentially thin plastic that connects two pieces (2). This is utilized in anything from food packaging, storage containers, shampoos, or even toys. 

In this case, the goal was thus to make a functional set of pliers in one print with no assembly. In regards to materials printing well together, adherence or bonding can be determined by similar chemical composition, surface energies, cooling rates, shrinking rates, and mechanical properties. For example, in a multimaterial print, ABS and TPU could thus be a good combination to print for in this project. Unfortunately, due to limited multimaterial  printers, this was performed in more than one print. For this reason, TPU and PLA were utilized. The goal of the assignment was thus to make a three part design incorporating two rigid and one elastic components.
