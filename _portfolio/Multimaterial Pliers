# Description (Purpose and Features)

Syringe pumps are motor-driven devices used to deliver precise volumes of fluid at a wide range of flow rates; for this reason, they are used in medical and laboratory settings. Syringe pumps operate simply in that a lead screw with a motor is turned which moves a carriage that pushes the syringe plunger forward and expels a controlled amount of liquid at a set pace. Unfortunately, commercial syringe pumps are often expensive, even for entry-level models, which limits their accessibility, particularly in low-resource or educational environments. To address this, a low-cost, open-source syringe pump built from 3D-printed components and Arduino-based controls is presented, with the goal of replicating the core functionality of these expensive commercial models while trying to make the device more accessible.
